## Python Versions

- using `pyenv versions` to check which python version you are on.
- show `pyenv which python` too.

- Installing multiple python versions.
- Important to keep each python version "clean".

- `pyenv global`, `pyenv local`, `pyenv shell` as ways to set default or override current python version.

- Installing packages should always be in a separate virtual environment (next section)
